# Advanced SQL Reports on Northwind

## Objective

This repository aims to showcase advanced reports built using SQL. The analyses provided here can be applied to businesses of all sizes that aspire to become more data-driven. These reports will help organizations extract valuable insights from their data, aiding in strategic decision-making.

## Reports to Create

1. **Revenue Reports**
    
    * What was the total revenue in 1997?

    ```sql
    -- I'm using Inner Join with subquery because it's more performative than use only a Left Join, because SQL executes FROM and Joins first, so it consumes less data
    -- If I use Left Join first and after that use Where to get only data from 1997, It'll demand more time and data to do.  
    CREATE VIEW total_revenues_1997_view AS
    SELECT SUM((order_details.unit_price) * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) AS total_revenues_1997
    FROM order_details
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT order_id 
        FROM orders 
        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = '1997'
    ) AS ord 
    ON ord.order_id = order_details.order_id;
    ```

    * Perform a monthly growth analysis and calculate YTD (Year-To-Date).

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_cumulative_revenues AS
    WITH MonthlyRevenues AS (
        SELECT
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM orders.order_date) AS Year,
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM orders.order_date) AS Month,
            SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) AS Monthly_Revenue
        FROM
            orders
        INNER JOIN
            order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
        GROUP BY
            EXTRACT(YEAR FROM orders.order_date),
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM orders.order_date)
    ),
    CumulativeRevenues AS (
        SELECT
            Year,
            Month,
            Monthly_Revenue,
            SUM(Monthly_Revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Month) AS YTD_Revenue
        FROM
            MonthlyRevenues
    )
    SELECT
        Year,
        Month,
        Monthly_Revenue,
        Monthly_Revenue - LAG(Monthly_Revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Month) AS Monthly_Change,
        YTD_Revenue,
        (Monthly_Revenue - LAG(Monthly_Revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Month)) / LAG(Monthly_Revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Month) * 100 AS Monthly_Percentage_Change
    FROM
        CumulativeRevenues
    ORDER BY
        Year, Month;

    ```

2. **Customer Segmentation**
    
    * What is the total amount paid by each customer?

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_total_revenues_per_customer AS
    SELECT 
        customers.company_name, 
        SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) AS total
    FROM 
        customers
    INNER JOIN 
        orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
    INNER JOIN 
        order_details ON order_details.order_id = orders.order_id
    GROUP BY 
        customers.company_name
    ORDER BY 
        total DESC;

    ```

    * Group customers into 5 segments based on total payments.

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_customer_segments AS
    SELECT 
        customers.company_name, 
        SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) AS total,
        NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) DESC) AS group_number
    FROM 
        customers
    INNER JOIN 
        orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
    INNER JOIN 
        order_details ON order_details.order_id = orders.order_id
    GROUP BY 
        customers.company_name
    ORDER BY 
        total DESC;

    ```


    * Identify customers in groups 3, 4, and 5 for targeted marketing

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW clients_for_marketing AS
    WITH marketing_clients AS (
        SELECT 
            customers.company_name, 
            SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) AS total,
            NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) DESC) AS group_number
        FROM 
            customers
        INNER JOIN 
            orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
        INNER JOIN 
            order_details ON order_details.order_id = orders.order_id
        GROUP BY 
            customers.company_name
        ORDER BY 
            total DESC
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM marketing_clients
    WHERE group_number >= 3;
    ```

3. **Top 10 Best-Selling Products**
    
    * Identify the 10 best-selling products.

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW top_10_products AS
    SELECT products.product_name, SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) AS sales
    FROM products
    INNER JOIN order_details ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id
    GROUP BY products.product_name
    ORDER BY sales DESC;
    ```

4. **UK Customers Paying Over $1,000**
    
    * Which UK customers have paid over $1,000?

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW uk_clients_over_1000 AS
    SELECT customers.contact_name, SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) AS payments
    FROM customers
    INNER JOIN orders ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
    INNER JOIN order_details ON order_details.order_id = orders.order_id
    WHERE LOWER(customers.country) = 'uk'
    GROUP BY customers.contact_name
    HAVING SUM(order_details.unit_price * order_details.quantity * (1.0 - order_details.discount)) > 1000;
    ```

## Initial Setup

### Manually

Use the provided `nortwhind.sql` file to populate your database.

### With Docker and Docker Compose

**Prerequisites**: Install Docker and Docker Compose

* [Get Started with Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps for Docker Setup:

1. **Start Docker Compose** 
    Run the following command to start the services:
    
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
    
    Wait for the config menssage, like:
    
    ```csharp
    Creating network "northwind_psql_db" with driver "bridge"
    Creating volume "northwind_psql_db" with default driver
    Creating volume "northwind_psql_pgadmin" with default driver
    Creating pgadmin ... done
    Creating db      ... done
    ```
       
2. **Connect to PgAdmi** Access PgAdmin at: [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050), with the password `postgres`. 

Configure a new server in PgAdmin:
    
    * **General Tab**:
        * Nome: db
    * **Connection Tab**:
        * Nome do host: db
        * Nome de usu√°rio: postgres
        * Senha: postgres 
        * Database: "northwind"

3. **Stop Docker Compose** Stop the services using Ctrl-C and remove containers with: `docker-compose up` 
    
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```
    
4. **Data Persistence** Database modifications persist in the Docker volume `postgresql_data` To delete data, run:
    
    ```
    docker-compose down -v
    ```
